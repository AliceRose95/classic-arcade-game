## Description

The player character must cross the stone tiles and successfully reach the water while avoiding the moving bugs.

The game is played with keyboard input and has a 3-life score system. 3 hits from bugs result in a "You lose" modal and the opportunity to restart, whereas 3 successful trips to the water result in a "You win" modal and restart button. Sounds accompany hits and wins to alert the player.

## How to play

Move the character up, down, left or right using your keyboards arrow keys. Head towards the water while avoiding the moving bugs on the stone tiles. If you hit a bug, you will lose a life. Lose three lives and the game is over. Reach the water three times without losing three lives and you will win the game.

## Dependencies

Sound files win.wav and lose.wav are found in the included sounds folder.
